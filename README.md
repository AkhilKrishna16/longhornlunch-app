# longhornlunch-app

If you would like to run the app on a local computer, first clone the main branch into your local machine.

First, install all packages using `npm install`. This installs all third-party packages that are used in the website.

Then, run the app using `npm run dev`. This stages the project in development mode to see live changes to the current version of the app.
